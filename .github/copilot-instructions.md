# Repo overview (big picture)

- This is a small, static website project served as plain HTML/CSS/JS. The main entry is `Index.html` (note the capital `I`) and the site is composed of multiple HTML pages: `Index.html`, `eras.html`, `subgenres.html`, `yearsgoneby.html`.
- Styles are primarily in `style.css` at the repository root. A secondary stylesheet `wireframe.css` is included from a hashed subfolder for layout/debugging purposes.
- Minimal JavaScript lives in a hashed subfolder (see example `e56758b5096.../nav.js`) and implements the accessible navigation (hamburger) behavior.

# Key files and patterns (be concrete)

- Entry point: `Index.html` — contains the `<nav>` markup and the `<script src="e56758b5.../nav.js"></script>` inclusion. Keep link paths exactly as written (case-sensitive on Linux).
- Styles: `style.css` — global typography, color and layout. Use this file for main styling changes; `wireframe.css` is intentionally included for alternate wireframe styles.
- Assets: `assets/images/` contains images and SVGs (for example `assets/images/txt+logo.svg`). There is also a hashed folder at the repo root that contains `wireframe.css` and `nav.js` — treat those as project-provided tooling rather than external packages.
- Navigation JS: `e56758b5096.../nav.js` — implements ARIA-friendly toggle behavior and keyboard handling. When editing, preserve ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) and the focus management code.

# Developer workflows (commands & tips)

- Local preview (no build step): from repo root run:

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  # then open http://localhost:8000/Index.html
  ```

- Live editing: you can open `Index.html` (or the repo) in VS Code and use the Live Server extension or the simple HTTP server above.
- Debugging JS: `nav.js` is loaded at the end of `Index.html`; changes to it require a full browser refresh. Because files live in hashed folders, be careful when moving or renaming files — update the `<script>` and `<link>` tags in HTML accordingly.

# Project-specific conventions

- Filename case is significant: `Index.html` (capital `I`) is referenced directly — preserve casing in links.
- Keep HTML links relative and consistent across pages (examples: `<a href="yearsgoneby.html">`, `<a href="eras.html">`).
- The project mixes a root `style.css` and a wireframe stylesheet located in a hashed directory. Do not collapse or remove the hashed folder unless you update all references in HTML.

# Integration & editing rules for AI agents

- When modifying navigation behavior, update only the `e56758b5096.../nav.js` file referenced in `Index.html` unless the HTML explicitly uses a different script. Preserve ARIA flow and keyboard handlers (Enter, Space, Escape) and the focus-on-open behavior.
- When adding assets, place them under `assets/images/` and update any `background-image` or `<img src="...">` references in `style.css` or HTML. Example CSS reference: `background-image: url("assets/images/txt+logo.svg");` in `style.css`.
- Do not rename `Index.html` to `index.html` — this will break links on Linux-dev and in the deployed environment.

# What I couldn't discover

- There is no build tooling, tests, or CI config in the repository. If you need to suggest adding CI (linting, accessibility checks), ask the maintainer before creating files.

# Guidance for PRs by AI agents

- Keep changes minimal and focused. For visual changes, include screenshots or a short checklist of manual verification steps.
- If you move files (e.g., relocate `nav.js`), update all HTML references and mention the change in the PR description.

If any of these paths or assumptions are incorrect (for example, if the hashed folder is generated by a build step), tell me where and I will merge updates into this file.
