        <h1>Subgenres</h1>
<h2> Emocore</h2>
        <section>
            <p><strong>Emocore</strong> — short for emotional hardcore — is the earliest form of emo, emerging in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene. It's essentially the first wave of emo, but the term “emocore” was often used (sometimes mockingly) to describe it before “emo” became the more common name.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rooted in hardcore punk, but more melodic and expressive</li>
                <li>Lyrics focused on personal emotion—pain, identity, frustration—rather than political themes</li>
                <li>Dynamic song structures: soft/loud shifts, shouted and sung vocals</li>
                <li>DIY ethic and raw, impassioned live performances</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Post Hardcore</h2>
            <p>Post-hardcore is a genre that evolved out of the hardcore punk scene in the early-to-mid 1980s. It retains hardcore’s aggression and DIY ethos but expands the musical and emotional range—more melody, more experimentation, more dynamics, and often more introspection.</p>

            <h3>What defines post-hardcore?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardcore intensity, but with more complex songwriting</li>
                <li>Use of melody, dissonance, and tempo shifts</li>
                <li>Lyrics range from political and social to deeply personal</li>
                <li>Embraces non-traditional song structures</li>
                <li>Often blends with emo, noise rock, math rock, or even metal</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Metalcore / Emo Violence</h2>
            <p><strong>Emoviolence</strong> (sometimes written emo-violence) is a subgenre of screamo that emerged in the mid-to-late 1990s, blending the emotional intensity of emo with the chaotic aggression of grindcore and hardcore punk. It’s fast, abrasive, messy, and cathartic—often sounding more like a nervous breakdown than a song.</p>

            <h3>Defining characteristics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Short, chaotic, high-intensity songs (often under 2 minutes)</li>
                <li>Screamed vocals, usually buried in the mix</li>
                <li>Raw, lo-fi production—emphasizing intensity over clarity</li>
                <li>Extreme dynamics—sudden tempo changes, blasts of noise, fragile quiet moments</li>
                <li>Lyrics tend to be oblique, emotional, and nihilistic or poetic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Despite the name, emoviolence isn’t about glorifying violence. It’s a reference to how emotionally and sonically violent the music feels.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Midwest Emo / Math Rock</h2>
            <p><strong>Math rock</strong> is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock known for its complex rhythms, irregular time signatures, and technical musicianship. It emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, drawing influence from progressive rock, post-hardcore, and experimental music—with bands intentionally breaking conventional song structures in favor of jagged, intricate, and cerebral compositions.</p>

            <h3>Why “math” rock?</h3>
            <p>The name comes from the genre’s tendency to sound “mathematical”—with unusual time signatures (like 7/8, 5/4, 11/8), abrupt tempo changes, and angular guitar riffs that feel like they were plotted on graph paper. It’s music that often prioritizes structure, texture, and rhythm over hooks or choruses.</p>

            <h3>Key features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex, often irregular time signatures</li>
                <li>Clean, interlocking guitar parts—often tapping, fingerpicking, or syncopated riffing</li>
                <li>Sparse or minimal vocals—many math rock bands are instrumental</li>
                <li>Start-stop dynamics and sudden shifts in tone or tempo</li>
                <li>Technical drumming and rhythmic experimentation</li>
            </ul>
