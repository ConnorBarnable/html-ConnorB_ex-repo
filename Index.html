      <h2>A Brief History</h2>
      <p>Emo is a genre of rock music characterized by emotional, often confessional lyrics. It emerged in the mid-1980s Washington, D.C., hardcore scene, where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore. The most important element of how emo came to be is its influences, as other genres continue to shape emo following its humble beginnings.</p>

      <h2>Years Gone By</h2>
      <p>Starting in the shadow of larger genres like hardcore, bands who would be labeled as emocore despised the title. Hardcore’s purpose was to make a statement, while emocore was labeled “soft” due to the topics and tones of its music. This is how the term emotional hardcore came to be.</p>
      <p>As the genre grew and entered the mainstream, it began to stray from its DIY roots. Second wave bands like Sunny Day Real Estate and The Get Up Kids found success on the radio, MTV, and global tours. While some purists dismissed these bands as “fake emo,” they too began in basements and local scenes before finding broader audiences.</p>
